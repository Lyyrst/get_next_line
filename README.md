<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The get_next_line project is one of the first project at 42 school. 

This involves creating a simple function capable of returning the first line of the file passed as arguments.
and if you call the function a second time, it will return the second line of the file, etc...

Calling this functions in a while() can return all the file line by line.

For this project we are limited to 10 function of 25 lines max.
